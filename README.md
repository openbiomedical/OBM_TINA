# OBM_TINA
TINA is a 3D printed mechanical hand moved by a system of rods thanks to the wrist movements. It is developed to mix mechanical functionality with a beautiful design, accessible to everyone in need, everywhere. Designed by the Polish jewelry designer Justyna Stasiewicz, it is a perfect example of the international collaborations of the OBM community and of the flexibility of its volunteers.

Justyna Stasiewicz comes from Koszalin - a small town in the North of Poland. Jewelry designer and 3D artist, currently she is living and working in Łódź where she is about to complete her PhD studies at the Academy of Fine Arts. At the same time, she teaches students on extramural studies to design jewelry using 3D softwares. She used her experience and creativity helping OBM to create a new design for a 3D printed mechanic hand - and this is how Tina has come to life.
